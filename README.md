CocktailsDB is an api that lets you showcase various drinks they have to offer. I use React.js and React Hooks to create this through "React Courses and Tutorials" on udemy. Not only does it show you a list of cocktails with pictures and titles, you can click on the details link to see a page devoted to each drink to learn more about it. There is also a search feature so you can narrow down the links of drinks to choose from.
